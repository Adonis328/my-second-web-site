<h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>A website (also written as a web site) is a collection of web pages and related content
  that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server.
  Examples of notable websites are Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Wikipedia.</p>
  <p>All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web.
  There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private network,
  such as a company's internal website for its employees.</p>
  <p>Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose,
  such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or social networking.
  Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page.</p>
  <p>Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
  The app used on these devices is called a web browser.</p>
